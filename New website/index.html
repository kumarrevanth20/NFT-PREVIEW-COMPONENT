                    A biker could technically be anyone who rides around on a motorbike, but typically, the term refers to people who ride motorcycles, often in a group. Bikers tend to have a rough reputation (although, like any stereotype, they are not always accurate).
        
                  Bikers have their own slang and even hand signals! These biker quotes are perfect for captioning your chopper or cruiser on your Instagram posts.
        
                  Even if you aren’t a hard-core biker, and are more of a weekend warrior, you can definitely relate to some of these biker quotes.
        
                  You might hear bikers call their girlfriends and wives “old ladies,” and it is their way of telling you they are off limits.
        
                  Bikers not only have their own slang, many often are members of clubs. Some clubs are AMA (American Motorcyclist Association) sanctioned while others are known as “outlaw clubs.”
        
                  The term outlaw club doesn’t mean the clubs engage in illegal activity, just that they follow their own bylaws, and not those set forth by the AMA. Keep reading to learn more about some of the more notorious motorcycle clubs.
